## Steps Followed in the Assignment

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- **Dataset Selected:** Daily courier partner activity.
- **Cleaning:** Removed outliers, filled missing values, and ensured data consistency.
- **Feature Engineering:** Added new features like day of the week, season, and weather conditions.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Visualization:** Analyzed trends in temperature, precipitation, and courier activity using graphs.
- **Insights:** Identified seasonal patterns and correlations impacting courier availability.

### 3. Feature Selection and Statistical Analysis
- **Approach:** Used Random Forest to determine feature importance.
- **Key Features:** Temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and day-of-week variables.

### 4. Model Training and Optimization
- **Models Used:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- **Optimization:** Fine-tuned hyperparameters for Random Forest and selected the best-performing model based on RMSE and RÂ² scores.

### 5. Cluster Analysis
- **Method:** KMeans clustering was applied to identify patterns in delivery locations.
- **Insights:** Cluster centroids provided key information about weather and courier activity trends.

### 6. Predictions
- **Questions Answered:**
  - Predicted next-day order volumes.
  - Forecasted courier availability for future dates.
  - Identified high-demand delivery locations.
- **Results:** Models delivered practical accuracy, aiding better resource allocation.
